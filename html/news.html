        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

			<h3>ABOUT OBSIDIAN</h3>
			<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>
